### Who am I
I was born in 1976 in Rosario (Argentina), moved soon to Buenos Aires (Argentina), and then to
Rome (Italy), where I grew up since 5 years old.
I love to dance, to act, to code, and to share.

I managed to somehow make a living of the last two ones
by working as a programmer, computer science researcher, and teacher.

I am currently a researcher in the [Semantic Technology Laboratory (STLab)](https://stlab.istc.cnr.it/), part of the [Institute for Cognitive Sciences and Technologies (ISTC)](https://www.istc.cnr.it/) of the [Italian National Research Council (CNR)](https://www.cnr.it/)
