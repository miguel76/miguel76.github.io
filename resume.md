### Short Bio

_As a researcher._
Since 2010 I have been researching __semantic technologies__ (Linked Data, Knowledge Graphs, Ontologies), both in general and applied to diverse specific application domains.
I also do some work in __computational genomics__, collaborating with biology researchers.
I have been working in [Sapienza University of Rome, Italy](http://www.uniroma1.it/),
[Queen Mary University of London, UK](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/),
[University of Bari, Italy](https://uniba.it/),
and [National Research Council, Italy](https://cnr.it/),
while having both local and international collaborations.

_As a teacher._
As __lecturer__, I taught 4 different modules in academy (in 4 different universities).
Previously I have been working as __teaching assistant__ (5 modules, during 2 years) in academy
and __teacher in high school__ (~2.5 school years).

<!--
I have been teaching Computer Science and Mathematics
in __high school__ (~__2.5 school years__ experience).

In academy I have been working as __teaching assistant__ (5 modules, during __2 years__)
and since 2016 I started teaching as a __lecturer__ (_3 modules_).
-->

_As a developer._
<!--
I started programming around 1986 (10-years old)
with the [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_BASIC)
of [C-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64 "Commodore 64"),
learnt hypertext and event-driven programming
with [HyperCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard)
on a [Mac Plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Plus "Macintosh Plus") in the early 90's,
met C in high school,
and went on to discover the Web, object oriented programming and
functional programming (what a joy!)
in college.
-->
I have around __20 years of professional experience
programming__ both for private companies (~5 years)
and for research in academy (~15 years)
using programming languages as Java, Javascript, Python,
query languages as SQL and [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/),
web and linked data languages, protocols, and paradigms as
HTML, HTTP, REST,
RDF(S), OWL, LDP, XML, XSLT.
