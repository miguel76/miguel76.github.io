### <span id="about">About me
__Miguel Ceriani__, italo-argentinian murguero, software developer, and researcher.
I was in 1976 in Rosario (Argentina), moved soon to Buenos Aires (Argentina), and then to
Rome (Italy), where I grew up since 5 years old.
I love to dance, to act, to code, and to share.
I managed to somehow make a living of the last two ones
by working as a programmer, computer science researcher and teacher.
I dance whenever (as almost whatever) I can, but mainly as a member of la Malamurga.
Occasionally I work also as an actor.
